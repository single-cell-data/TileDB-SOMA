# TileDB-SOMA

[SOMA](https://github.com/single-cell-data/SOMA/tree/main) – for “Stack Of Matrices, Annotated” – is a flexible, extensible, and open-source API enabling access to data in a variety of formats. The driving use case of SOMA is for single-cell data in the form of annotated matrices where observations are frequently cells and features are genes, proteins, or genomic regions.

The TileDB-SOMA package is a C++ library with APIs in Python and R, using [TileDB
Embedded](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB) to implement the
[SOMA specification](https://github.com/single-cell-data/SOMA/blob/main/abstract_specification.md).

Get started on using TileDB-SOMA:

* [Quick start](#quick-start).
* Python [documentation](https://tiledbsoma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python-api.html). 
* R [documentation](https://single-cell-data.github.io/TileDB-SOMA/).


## What Can TileDB-SOMA Do?

Intended to be used for single-cell data, TileDB-SOMA provides Python and R APIs to allow for storage and data access patterns at scale and for larger-than-memory operations:


* Create and write large volumes of data.
* Open and read data at low latency, locally and from the cloud.
* Query and access interconnected arrays efficiently and at low latency.

TileDB-SOMA provides interoperability with existing single-cell toolkits:

* Load and create [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) objects.
* Load and create [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) objects.

TileDB-SOMA provides interoperability with existing Python or R data structures:

* From Python create PyArrow objects, SciPy sparse matrices, NumPy arrays, and pandas data frames.
* From R create R Arrow objects, sparse matrices (via the [Matrix](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Matrix) package), and standard data frames and (dense) matrices.


## Community

* Please join the [TileDB Slack community](https://tiledb-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-ndq1ipwl-QcithaWG6j1BImtuQGSpag#/shared-invite/email) with dedicated channel `#genomics`.
* Please join the [CZI Slack community](https://cziscience.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-czl1kp2v-sgGpY4RxO3bPYmFg2XlbZA#/shared-invite/email), with dedicated
channel `#cellxgene-census-users`.


## APIs Installation and Quick Start <a id="quick-start"></a>

* [Python installation and quick start](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/wiki/Python-quick-start)
* [R installation and quick start](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/wiki/R-quick-start)

## API Documentation

The TileDB-SOMA doc-site ([Python](https://tiledbsoma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python-api.html)|[R](https://single-cell-data.github.io/TileDB-SOMA/)), contains the reference documentation and tutorials.

Reference documentation can also be accessed directly from Python `help(tiledsoma)` or R `help(package = "tiledbsoma")`.

## Main SOMA Objects

The capabilities of TileDB-SOMA lay on the different read, access, and query patterns that each of the main implementations of SOMA objects provide:

* `DenseNDArray` is a dense, N-dimensional array, with offset (zero-based) integer indexing on each dimension.
* `SparseNDArray` is the same as `DenseNDArray` but sparse, and supports point indexing (disjoint index access).
* `DataFrame` is a multi-column table with a user-defined columns names and value types, with support for point indexing. 
* `Collection` is a persistent container of named SOMA objects.
* `Experiment` is a class that represents a single-cell experiment. It always contains two objects:
	* `obs`: a  `DataFrame` with primary annotations on the observation axis.
	* `ms`: a  `Collection` of measurements, each composed of `X` matrices and axis annotation matrices or data frames (e.g. `var`, `varm`, `obsm`, etc).

## Who Is Using SOMA?

* [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) to build its [Census](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene-census/), which provides efficient access and querying to a corpus containing nearly 50 million cells, compiled from 700+ datasets.

## Issues and Contacts

* Any/all questions, comments, and concerns are welcome at the [GitHub new-issue page](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/issues/new/choose) -- or, you can also browse [existing issues](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/issues).
* If you believe you have found a security issue, in lieu of filing an issue please responsibly disclose it by contacting [security@tiledb.com](mailto:security@tiledb.com).


## Branches

This branch, `main`, implements the [updated specfication](https://github.com/single-cell-data/SOMA/blob/main/abstract_specification.md).  Please also see the `main-old` branch which implements the [original specification](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/blob/main-old/spec/specification.md).
