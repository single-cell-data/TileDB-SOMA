# TileDB-SOMA

SOMA -- _stack of matrices, annotated_ -- is a flexible, extensible, and open-source API enabling access
to data in a variety of formats.

The TileDB-SOMA package is a C++ library with APIs in Python and R, using [TileDB
Embedded](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB) to implement the
[SOMA specification](https://github.com/single-cell-data/SOMA/blob/main/abstract_specification.md).
