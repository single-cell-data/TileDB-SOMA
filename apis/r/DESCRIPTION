Title: TileDB Single Cell SOMA API
Description: Interface for working with 'TileDB'-based Stack of Matrices,
    Annotated ('SOMA'): an open data model for representing annotated matrices,
    like those commonly used for single cell data analysis. Users can import
    from and export to in-memory formats used by popular toolchains like
    'Seurat', 'Bioconductor', and even 'AnnData' using the companion Python
    package.
