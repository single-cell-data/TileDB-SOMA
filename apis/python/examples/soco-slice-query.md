Here we show an example of doing a _slice query_ across a `SOMACollection` -- we extract a
relatively small subset out of the full collection for analysis.

A key point is that these data (shown here on local disk) can likewise be stored on object stores
like S3. (Best performance is obtained by querying from an in-region EC2 instances.) This means you
can _query_ large datasets without having to first _download_ large datasets.

Another key point is that the _out-of-core processing_ showing here allows you to slice data out of
a collection which is far larger than fits in RAM.

## Do the slice query

Using [soco-slice-query.py](soco-slice-query.py)

```
TWO-SIDED QUERY
Wrote mini-atlas-two-sided.h5ad (8524, 1)
Wrote mini-atlas-two-sided (8524, 1)

OBS-ONLY QUERY
Wrote mini-atlas-obs-sided.h5ad (8524, 21648)
Wrote mini-atlas-obs-sided (8524, 21648)

VAR-ONLY QUERY
Wrote mini-atlas-var-sided.h5ad (181544, 1)
Wrote mini-atlas-var-sided (181544, 1)

OBS-ONLY QUERY
Wrote cell-ontology-236.h5ad (8524, 21648)
Wrote cell-ontology-236 (8524, 21648)
```
