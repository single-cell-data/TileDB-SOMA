## [Release 1.17.0]

The primary change in 1.17.0 is the upgrade to TileDB 2.28.

### Added

- \[[#3740](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/pull/3740)\] [python] Add experimental Dask-backed `to_anndata` functionality to `SparseNDArray` and `ExperimentAxisQuery`.

### Changed

- \[\[[#4057](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/pull/4057)\] [c++] Update [TileDB core to 2.28.0](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/blob/main/HISTORY.md#tiledb-v2280-release-notes)
- \[[#4023](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/pull/4023)\] [c++] Use nanoarrow ArrowSchemaSetTypeDateTime for datetime values. Dictionary type with timestamp value type will raise error on read.

### Fixed

- \[[#4040](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/pull/4040)\] [python] suppress insignificant overflow warning from numpy.
- \[[#4050](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/pull/4050)\] DataFrame `count` and SparseNDArray `nnz` fix - report correct number of cells in array in the case where a delete query had been previously applied.
- \[[#4055](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/pull/4055)\] Various `open()` code paths failed to check the SOMA encoding version number, and would fail with cryptic errors.
