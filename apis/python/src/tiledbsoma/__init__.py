# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The way this works is:
#
# o We put a `[tool.setuptools_scm]` stanza in pyproject.toml.
#
# o When the user does `pip install .` the src/tiledbsoma/_version.py
#   file gets created. We have a .gitignore line for that since it
#   isn't supposed to go into version control, but rather, is supposed
#   to be created at package-setup time.
#
# o The src/tiledbsoma/_version.py is created by setuptools by reading
#   Git history. If the currently checked-out code is at a version stamp
#   like `1.2.3` we'll get `__version__` being `1.2.3`; else we'll get
#   something like `1.2.4.dev2`.
#
# o When the user does `import tiledbsoma` this code here is run,
#   which loads the `src/tiledbsoma/_version.py`.
#
# In summary, who needs to do what:
#
# o Package developers: simply create a Git release at
# https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SingleCell/releases
#
# o Package users: just `pip install .`.
