            type:
                The Arrow type to be stored in the NDArray.
                If the type is unsupported, an error will be raised.
            shape:
                The maximum capacity of each dimension, including room
                for any intended future appends, as a sequence.  E.g. ``(100, 10)``.
                All lengths must be in the positive int64 range, or ``None``.  It's
                necessary to say ``shape=(None, None)`` or ``shape=(None, None,
                None)``, as the sequence length determines the number of dimensions
                N in the N-dimensional array.

                For :class:`SparseNDArray` only, if a slot is None, then the minimum
                possible range will be used.  This makes a :class:`SparseNDArray`
                growable using ``resize``.
            platform_config:
                Platform-specific options used to create this array.
                This may be provided as settings in a dictionary, with options
                located in the ``{'tiledb': {'create': ...}}`` key,
                or as a :class:`~tiledbsoma.TileDBCreateOptions` object.
            tiledb_timestamp:
                If specified, overrides the default timestamp
                used to open this object. If unset, uses the timestamp provided by
                the context.

        Returns:
            The created NDArray.

        Raises:
            TypeError:
                If the ``type`` is unsupported.
            ValueError:
                If the ``shape`` is unsupported.
            tiledbsoma.AlreadyExistsError:
                If the underlying object already exists at the given URI.
            tiledbsoma.NotCreateableError:
                If the URI is malformed for a particular storage backend.
            TileDBError:
