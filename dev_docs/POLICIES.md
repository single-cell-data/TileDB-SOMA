# TileDB-SOMA Development Policies

## Version policy

TileDB-SOMA uses a loose variation of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to organize and govern API compatibility, deprecations and version numbers.

TileDB-SOMA also uses lifecycle tags to indicate the maturity of an interface. All public API should have a lifecycle tag in docstrings. These tags are patterned after the RStudio lifecycle stage model. Tags are:

- `experimental`: Under active development and may undergo significant and breaking changes.
- `maturing`: Under active development but the interface and behavior have stabilized and are unlikely to change significantly but breaking changes are still possible.
- `stable`: The interface is considered stable and breaking changes will be avoided where possible. Breaking changes that cannot be avoided will be accompanied by a major version bump.
- `deprecated`: The API is no longer recommended for use and will be removed in a future release.

If no tag is present, the state is `experimental`.

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to version 2.0, TileDB-SOMA had no explicit version policy. Versioning was most commonly `1.MAJOR.MINOR`,
> where breaking changes would occur in `1.X` releases, and any other change could occur on `1.X.Y` versions.
> Starting with `2.0.0`, versioning will be aligned with the SemVer `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` schema.

A release number is comprised of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

For **non-experimental** interfaces and features:

- API breaking changes should occur only in `major` releases. These changes will be documented in the Python HISTORY.md or R NEWS.md change logs, with guidance on what has changed, and how to migrate code to the new version. When possible, advance warning will be provided prior to breaking changes.
- Deprecations may be introduced in `major` or `minor` releases. A deprecation will maintain existing functionality, but provide a warning about the upcoming API change, and any available guidance on migration. Deprecations must be documented in the appropriate change log.
- Warnings of future compatibility changes, which are not "deprecate and remove", may be introduced in a `major` or `minor` release. Future compatibility warnings must be included in the appropriate change log.
- A `patch` release may not introduce deprecations or future incompatibility change warnings.

Experimental features may be modified in a `major` or `minor` release without prior warning. However, where possible, advance warning of changes will be provided.

## Warning period

Breaking API changes will provide notice of at least two `minor` releases or six months, whichever is greater, before effecting the change.

## Implementing Deprecation

### Python deprecations

Upon deprecation of Python functionality:

- a `DeprecationWarning` must be issued by the deprecated functionality and a unit test provided to confirm warning issuance.
- affected lifecyle tags must be set to "deprecated", typically in the docstring and other user-visible documentation.
- docstrings must clearly indicate the scope of deprecation (e.g, function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- HISTORY.md must clearly indicate the deprecation and any guidance on migration.

For other breaking changes which are not "deprecate and remove":

- a `FutureWarning` must be issued by the deprecated functionality and a unit test provided to confirm warning issuance.
- docstrings must clearly indicate the scope of the breaking change (e.g, function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration
- HISTORY.md must clearly indicate the breaking change and any guidance on migration.

Where entire classes, methods or functions are deprecated:

- utilize `typing_extensions.deprecated` decorator to provide both static and runtime warnings.
- update unit tests to ensure that the warning is issued (e.g., utilize `pytest.deprecated_call()`).
- ensure that `stacklevel` is set so that the warning comes from the invoking (caller's) code.

### R deprecations

Upon deprecation of R functionality, methods, or functions:

- a deprecation warning generated by `lifecycle::deprecate_warn()` must be issued by the deprecated functionality, and a unit test `lifecycle::expect_deprecated()` provided to confirm warning issuance.
- if any parameters are being deprecated, they must be given a default value of `lifecycle::deprecated()`.
- documentation must clearly indicate the scope of deprecation (e.g., function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the deprecation and any guidance on migration.

R functionality additionally enters a defunct stage beginning two `minor` releases after the deprecation:

- a defunct error generated by `lifecycle::deprecate_soft()` must be issued, and a unit test `lifecycle::expect_defunct()` provided to confirm error issuance.
- documentation must clearly indicate the scope of defunct status (e.g, function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the defunct status and any guidance on migration.

At next major release after the defunct status, the affected R functionality must be removed.

For other breaking changes which are not "deprecate and remove":

- a warning must be issued by the deprecated functionality and a unit test provided to confirm warning issuance.
- documentation must clearly indicate the scope of the breaking change (e.g, function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the breaking change and any guidance on migration.
- this warning must last for two `minor` releases following the breaking change, after which it may be reclassed as a `message()` or removed entirely.

Where entire classes (S4, RC, and R6) are deprecated:

- a deprecation warning generated by `.Deprecated()` must be issued by the deprecated class's constructor method `initialize()`, and a unit test provided to confirm warning issueance. The replacement class must be specified using the `msg = ` parameter to `.Deprecated()`.
- documentation must clearly indicate the deprecation and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the deprecation and any guidance on migration.

R classes additionally enter a defunct stage begining two `minor` releases after the deprecation:

- a defunct error generated by `.Defunct()` must be issued, and a unit test provided to confirm error issuance. The replacement class must be specified using the `msg = ` parameter to `.Deprecated()`.
- documentation must clearly indicate the defunct status and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the defunct status and any guidance on migration.

At next major release after the defunct status, the affected R classes must be removed.
