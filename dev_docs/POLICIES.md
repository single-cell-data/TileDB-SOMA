# TileDB-SOMA Development Policies

## Version policy

TileDB-SOMA uses a loose variation of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to organize and govern API compatibility, deprecations and version numbers.

TileDB-SOMA also uses lifecycle tags to indicate the maturity of an interface. All public API should have a lifecycle tag in docstrings. These tags are patterned after the RStudio lifecycle stage model. Tags are:

- `experimental`: Under active development and may undergo significant and breaking changes.
- `maturing`: Under active development but the interface and behavior have stabilized and are unlikely to change significantly but breaking changes are still possible.
- `stable`: The interface is considered stable and breaking changes will be avoided where possible. Breaking changes that cannot be avoided will be accompanied by a major version bump.
- `deprecated`: The API is no longer recommended for use and will be removed in a future release.

If no tag is present, the state is `experimental`.

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to version 2.0, TileDB-SOMA had no explicit version policy. Versioning was most commonly `1.MAJOR.MINOR`,
> where breaking changes would occur in `1.X` releases, and any other change could occur on `1.X.Y` versions.
> Starting with `2.0.0`, versioning will be aligned with the SemVer `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` schema.

A release number is comprised of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

For **non-experimental** interfaces and features:

- API breaking changes should occur only in `major` releases. These changes will be documented in the Python HISTORY.md or R NEWS.md change logs, with guidance on what has changed, and how to migrate code to the new version. When possible, advance warning will be provided prior to breaking changes.
- Deprecations may be introduced in `major` or `minor` releases. A deprecation will maintain existing functionality, but provide a warning about the upcoming API change, and any available guidance on migration. Deprecations must be documented in the appropriate change log.
- Warnings of future compatibility changes, which are not "deprecate and remove", may be introduced in a `major` or `minor` release. Future compatibility warnings must be included in the appropriate change log.
- A `patch` release may not introduce deprecations or future incompatibility change warnings.
- Changes to the [TileDB storage format](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/tree/main/format_spec) will only occur on a `major` release.
- Changes to the [TileDB-SOMA encoding specification](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/blob/main/encoding_specification.md) that are backward- or forward-incompatible will only occur on a `major` release.

## Warning period

For breaking API changes and backward-incompatible updates to the TileDB-SOMA encoding specification, we will generally provide notice of at least two minor releases or 3 months (whichever is greater) before the change takes effect. In rare scenarios where we are unable to adhere to this policy, the discrepancies will be clearly highlighted in the changelog.

Advance warning may not be provided for changes to:

- experimental features in a `major` or `minor` release.
- the [TileDB-SOMA encoding specification](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/blob/main/encoding_specification.md) that are backward compatible.
- the [TileDB storage format](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/tree/main/format_spec).

## Implementing Deprecation

### Python deprecations

Upon deprecation of Python functionality:

- a `DeprecationWarning` must be issued by the deprecated functionality and a unit test provided to confirm warning issuance.
- affected lifecyle tags must be set to "deprecated", typically in the docstring and other user-visible documentation.
- docstrings must clearly indicate the scope of deprecation (e.g., function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- HISTORY.md must clearly indicate the deprecation and any guidance on migration.

For other breaking changes which are not "deprecate and remove":

- a `FutureWarning` must be issued by the deprecated functionality and a unit test provided to confirm warning issuance.
- docstrings must clearly indicate the scope of the breaking change (e.g, function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration
- HISTORY.md must clearly indicate the breaking change and any guidance on migration.

Where entire classes, methods or functions are deprecated:

- utilize `typing_extensions.deprecated` decorator to provide both static and runtime warnings.
- update unit tests to ensure that the warning is issued (e.g., utilize `pytest.deprecated_call()`).
- ensure that `stacklevel` is set so that the warning comes from the invoking (caller's) code.

### R deprecations

Upon deprecation of R functionality, methods, or functions:

- a deprecation warning generated by `lifecycle::deprecate_warn()` must be issued by the deprecated functionality, and a unit test `lifecycle::expect_deprecated()` provided to confirm warning issuance.
- if any parameters are being deprecated, they must be given a default value of `lifecycle::deprecated()`.
- documentation must clearly indicate the scope of deprecation (e.g., function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the deprecation and any guidance on migration.

R functionality additionally enters a defunct stage, in which an error is thrown and the function or parameter stop working, beginning two `minor` releases or 3 months, whichever is greater, after the deprecation:

- a defunct error generated by `lifecycle::deprecate_soft()` must be issued, and a unit test `lifecycle::expect_defunct()` provided to confirm error issuance.
- documentation must clearly indicate the scope of defunct status (e.g, function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the defunct status and any guidance on migration.

At next major release after the defunct status, the affected R functionality must be removed.

For other breaking changes which are not "deprecate and remove":

- a warning must be issued by the deprecated functionality and a unit test provided to confirm warning issuance.
- documentation must clearly indicate the scope of the breaking change (e.g, function, a particular set of parameters, etc) and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the breaking change and any guidance on migration.
- this warning must last for two `minor` releases following the breaking change, after which it may be reclassed as a `message()` or removed entirely.

Where entire classes (S4, RC, and R6) are deprecated:

- a deprecation warning generated by `.Deprecated()` must be issued by the deprecated class's constructor method `initialize()`, and a unit test provided to confirm warning issueance. The replacement class must be specified using the `msg = ` parameter to `.Deprecated()`.
- documentation must clearly indicate the deprecation and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the deprecation and any guidance on migration.

R classes additionally enter a defunct stage, in which an error is thrown and the class can no longer be used, begining two `minor` releases or three months, which is greater, after the deprecation:

- a defunct error generated by `.Defunct()` must be issued, and a unit test provided to confirm error issuance. The replacement class must be specified using the `msg = ` parameter to `.Deprecated()`.
- documentation must clearly indicate the defunct status and must include actionable guidance on migration.
- `NEWS.md` must clearly indicate the defunct status and any guidance on migration.

At next major release after the defunct status, the affected R classes must be removed.
