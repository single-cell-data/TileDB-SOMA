TileDB-SOMA Python API Reference
================================

**SOMA is a unified data model and API for single-cell data.**

If you know about ``obs``, ``var``, and ``X``, you'll recognize what you're seeing.

The `data model and API <https://github.com/single-cell-data>`_ --- here as implemented using the `TileDB storage engine <https://tiledb.com>`_ --- allow you to persist, investigate, and share annotated 2D matrices, commonly used in single-cell biology.

Features:

* Flexible, extensible, and open-source API
* Supports access to persistent, cloud-resident annotated 2D matrix datasets
* Enables use within popular data science environments (e.g., R, Python), using the tools of that environment (e.g., Python Pandas integration), with the same storage regardless of language
* Allows interoperability with multiple tools including AnnData, Scanpy, Seurat, and Bioconductor
* Cloud-native TileDB arrays allow you to slice straight from remote storage
* Reduces costs and processing time by utilizing cost-efficient object storage services like S3
* Enables out-of-core access to data aggregations much larger than single-host main memory
* Enables distributed computation over datasets
