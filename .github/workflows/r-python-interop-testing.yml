      # Uncomment these next two stanzas as needed whenever we've just released a new tiledb-r for
      # which source is available but CRAN releases (and hence update r2u binaries) are not yet:
      #
      # IMPORTANT: these two stanzas should remain uncommented _only_ during the propagation time
      # between (a) publication of source for a new TileDB-R _upon which_ TileDB-SOMA depends in its
      # apis/R/DESCRIPTION file and (b) appearance of binaries.
      #
      # Please see https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/wiki/Branches-and-releases which
      # is crucial for anyone doing releases of TileDB-SOMA.
      #
      # Please edit both files in the same way:
      # * r-ci.yml
      # * r-python-interop-testing.yml
      #
      # Do not remove these comments until such time as we have eliminated our dependency on
      # the TileDB-R package.
