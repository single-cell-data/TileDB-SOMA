name: TileDB-SOMA Python CI (Minimal)

# This workflow calls ./python-ci-single.yml on a limited subset of the
# {os} x {python version} matrix. It runs for all branches, in contrast to
# ./python-ci-full.yml, which exhausts the matrix but only for main & releases,
# since that's CI-resource-intensive.
#
# To test the full matrix on a working branch, invoke ./python-ci-full.yml from
#   https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA/actions/workflows/python-ci-full.yml
